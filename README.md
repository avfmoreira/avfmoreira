# Andr√© Moreira - @avfmoreira

## Hi there üëã 
I'm Andr√©, I make money working with justice - but I'm not the Batman. At the last 10 years I have working on Court of Justice of Sao Paulo, but I intend to working with tech at some point in a near future.
## What I do
I am passionate about open source. Recently I find up even if I do not know write the language of a project has being writing I can help the community writing documentation or translate it. So, that is what I am trying to do. Ops, I'm doing, cause there is no try. ![yoda-emoji](https://github.com/avfmoreira/avfmoreira/blob/main/yoda-emoji.webp)
