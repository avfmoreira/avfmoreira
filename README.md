# André Moreira - @avfmoreira

## Hi there 👋 
I'm André, I make money working with justice - but I'm not the Batman.

Since my young age I am a tech passionate and soon started a job in a small company building front-end to websites, cropping layouts and build pages that should worked well cross-browser, include IE6. 

However, years late my life turn upside down and I came in a law school. Soon I got a public job which is my job currently. I have working as a legal assessor since then. 

The life is not straightforward and I was still have feeling tech calling me. Although in a law role about 10 years, so in 2023 very beginning I started to apply my energy and discipline in what I love, technnology.

To me answer the ask "It is all right, why is it not working?" is a challenge that gets me engaged. After that, when I realize I know the right answer that is pretty awesome. 

I have not preference about which technologies working with, cause my joy comes through the possibility to solve a issue that, well, I do not know how.

## What I do
I am passionate about open source. Recently I realized even if I do not know write the language of a project has being writing I can help the community writing documentation or translate it. So, that is what I am trying to do. Ops, I'm doing, cause there is no try (thanks, Master Yoda).
